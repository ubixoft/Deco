    /**
     * Deploy multiple TypeScript files that use Wrangler for bundling and deployment to Cloudflare Workers. You must provide a package.json file with the necessary dependencies and a wrangler.toml file matching the Workers for Platforms format. Use 'main_module' instead of 'main', and define bindings using the [[bindings]] array, where each binding is a table specifying its type and properties. To add custom Deco bindings, set type = "MCP" in a binding entry (these will be filtered and handled automatically).
     * Common patterns:
     * 1. Use a package.json file to manage dependencies:
     * // package.json
     * {
     * "name": "@deco/workers-example",
     * "private": true,
     * "version": "0.0.0",
     * "type": "module",
     * "scripts": {
     * "dev": "deco dev",
     * "gen": "deco gen > env.gen.ts",
     * "setup": "npm i -g deco-cli",
     * "deploy": "wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir ./dist && deco deploy ./dist"
     * },
     * "dependencies": {
     * "@cloudflare/workers-types": "^4.20250617.0",
     * "@deco/mcp": "npm:@jsr/deco__mcp@^0.5.6",
     * "@deco/workers-runtime": "npm:@jsr/deco__workers-runtime@^0.4.0",
     * "@mastra/core": "0.12.1",
     * "zod": "^3.25.67"
     * },
     * "devDependencies": {
     * "wrangler": "^4.13.2"
     * },
     * "engines": {
     * "node": ">=20.0.0"
     * }
     * }
     * 2. Import dependencies directly in your files:
     * // main.ts
     * import { z } from "zod";
     * import { withRuntime } from "@deco/workers-runtime";
     * 3. Use wrangler.toml to configure your app:
     * // wrangler.toml
     * name = "app-slug"
     * compatibility_date = "2025-06-17"
     * main_module = "main.ts"
     * kv_namespaces = [
     * { binding = "TODO", id = "06779da6940b431db6e566b4846d64db" }
     * ]
     * routes = [
     * { pattern = "my.example.com", custom_domain = true }
     * ]
     * browser = { binding = "MYBROWSER" }
     * [triggers]
     * # Schedule cron triggers:
     * crons = [ "*\/3 * * * *", "0 15 1 * *", "59 23 LW * *" ]
     * # This is required when using the Workflow class
     * [[durable_objects.bindings]]
     * name = "DECO_CHAT_WORKFLOW_DO"
     * class_name = "Workflow"
     * [[durable_objects.bindings]]
     * name = "MY_DURABLE_OBJECT"
     * class_name = "MyDurableObject"
     * # This is required when using the Workflow class
     * [[migrations]]
     * tag = "v1"
     * new_classes = ["Workflow", "MyDurableObject"]
     * [ai]
     * binding = "AI"
     * [[queues.consumers]]
     * queue = "queues-web-crawler"
     * max_batch_timeout = 60
     * [[queues.producers]]
     * queue = "queues-web-crawler"
     * binding = "CRAWLER_QUEUE"
     * [[deco.bindings]]
     * type = "MCP"
     * name = "MY_BINDING"
     * value = "INTEGRATION_ID"
     * # You can add any supported binding type as per Workers for Platforms documentation.
     * 4. You should always surround the user fetch with the withRuntime function.
     * import { withRuntime } from "@deco/workers-runtime";
     * const { Workflow, ...workerAPIs } = withRuntime({
     * fetch: async (request: Request, env: any) => {
     * return new Response("Hello from Cloudflare Workers!");
     * }
     * })
     * export { Workflow };
     * export default workerAPIs;
     * You must use the Workers for Platforms TOML format for wrangler.toml. The bindings supports all standard binding types (ai, analytics_engine, assets, browser_rendering, d1, durable_object_namespace, hyperdrive, kv_namespace, mtls_certificate, plain_text, queue, r2_bucket, secret_text, service, tail_consumer, vectorize, version_metadata, etc). For Deco-specific bindings, use type = "MCP".
     * For routes, only custom domains are supported. The user must point their DNS to the script endpoint. $SCRIPT.deco.page using DNS-Only. The user needs to wait for the DNS to propagate before the app will be available.
     * Example of files deployment:
     * [
     * {
     * "path": "package.json",
     * "content": `{
     * "name": "@deco/workers-example",

     * Important Notes:
     * - You can access the app workspace by accessing env.DECO_CHAT_WORKSPACE
     * - You can access the app script slug by accessing env.DECO_CHAT_APP_SLUG
     * - Token and workspace can be used to make authenticated requests to the Deco API under https://api.deco.chat
     * - Always use Cloudflare Workers syntax with export default and proper fetch handler signature
     * - When using template literals inside content strings, escape backticks with a backslash (\) or use string concatenation (+)
     * - You must include a package.json file with the @deco/workers-runtime dependency
     * - Dependencies are managed through npm packages in package.json, not npm: or jsr: specifiers
     * - Wrangler will handle the bundling process using the dependencies defined in package.json
