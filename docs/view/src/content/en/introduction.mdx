**Deco is an open-source foundation for building AI-native software.**

Create MCP servers that expose tools and workflows to AI agents, with optional custom web interfaces, all deployed on Cloudflare's global edge network.

## Who is it for?

- **Vibecoders** prototyping ideas
- **Agentic engineers** deploying scalable, secure, and sustainable production
  systems

## Why Deco?

Our goal is simple: empower teams with Generative AI by giving builders
the tools to create AI applications that scale beyond the initial demo and
into the thousands of users, securely and cost-effectively.

## Core capabilities

- **Open-source Runtime** – Easily compose tools, workflows, and views within a
  single codebase
- **MCP Mesh (Model Context Protocol)** – Securely integrate models, data
  sources, and APIs, with observability and cost control
- **Unified TypeScript Stack** – Combine backend logic and custom React/Tailwind
  frontends seamlessly using typed RPC
- **Global, Modular Infrastructure** – Built on Cloudflare for low-latency,
  infinitely scalable deployments. Self-host with your Cloudflare API Key
- **Visual Workspace** – Build agents, connect tools, manage permissions, and
  orchestrate everything built in code

## Core Concepts

Before diving in, let's quickly define a few core concepts:

### Tools
Functions that can be called by agents, workflows, views and other tools to perform 
actions like API calls, database queries, or computations.

```typescript
const createCepSearchTool = (env: Env) =>
  createTool({
    id: "CEP_SEARCH",
    description: "Search Brazilian postal codes",
    inputSchema: z.object({ cep: z.string() }),
    outputSchema: z.object({ city: z.string(), state: z.string() }),
    execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
      // Tool implementation
    },
  });
```

### Workflows
Deterministic sequences that orchestrate multiple steps, that frequently are tools, 
for creating automations.

```typescript
const createCustomerWorkflow = (env: Env) =>
  createWorkflow({ id: "REGISTER_CUSTOMER" })
    .then(validateInput)
    .then(saveToDatabase) 
    .then(sendWelcomeEmail)
    .commit();
```

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
The standard that connects AI models to your tools. Your Cloudflare Worker serves as an MCP server that agents can discover and use.

### Agents
AI assistants configured with access to your tools. They understand natural language and decide when to call specific tools to help users.

### Views
Optional React frontends that provide custom interfaces for your tools and workflows.
