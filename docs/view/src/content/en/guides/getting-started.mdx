# Getting Started

Welcome to deco! This guide will help you create your first MCP server with a beautiful documentation site.

<StepGroup>
  <Step number={1} title="Create a project">
    Run the following command to create a project:
    
    ```bash
    npm create deco@latest
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step number={2} title="Start development">
    Navigate to your project directory and start the development server:
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    This starts both the MCP server and the documentation site with hot reload.
  </Step>

  <Step number={3} title="Deploy to production">
    When you're ready to deploy:
    
    ```bash
    deco deploy
    ```
    
    Your app will be available at a public URL with both the MCP server and documentation.
