## 🎯 What is deco.chat Agent Workspace?

**deco.chat Agent Workspace** is an open-source platform designed to empower anyone to quickly create AI agents that don't just communicate through text—but **through rich, interactive UI**. Text is not everything. Your agents should visually express data, actions, and insights, leveraging an extensible chat interface that brings powerful UI elements directly into conversations.

Agents built with deco.chat dynamically assemble themselves, connecting automatically to thousands of high-quality, strongly-typed MCPs (**Model Context Protocols**) available for popular databases, services, and APIs. This means your agents seamlessly understand how to interact with your existing tools and immediately provide value, saving you hours of setup and configuration.
